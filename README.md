How I pushed this project to GitLab

- I initialized a local git repo, added a `.gitignore`, and made an initial commit.
- You provided the GitLab URL `https://gitlab.com/adarshdessai4/test_inf_hr_clnc` and I added it as the `origin` remote.
- The remote already had a README; I merged the remote README with this project README and resolved the merge conflict.

If you want to push from your machine, run:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/adarshdessai4/test_inf_hr_clnc.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
